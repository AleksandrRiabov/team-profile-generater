# Team Profile Generator

## Description 
This Node.js application allows you to generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each member of a software engineering team. The program uses Inquirer to prompt the user for information about each employee, such as their name, email, as well as specific information unique to their role on the team, such as GitHub usernames for engineers and school names for interns.

Once you have inputted all the required information, the application will generate an HTML file that displays each employee's summary in an organized and easy-to-read format. You can then easily share this file with others on your team or with stakeholders who need to stay informed about who is working on the project.

The program comes with a comprehensive set of tests to ensure that every aspect of the code is working correctly. You can run these tests at any time to verify that your code is functioning properly and that all the required features are working as expected.
